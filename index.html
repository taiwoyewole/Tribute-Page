					Isaac Newton was born on <time datetime="2019-08-04">25 December, 1642</time> at Woolsthorpe Manor in Woolsthorpe-by-Colsterworth in the county of Lincolnshire. He was named after his father who died three months before Isaac Newton was born. His mother "Hannah Ayscough" said that Newton was a small child as he was born prematurely and he could fit inside a quart mug. His mother remarried when he was three years old and left him in care of his maternal grandma "Margery Ayscough" while she went to live with her new husband. 
				</p>
				<p>
					From age twelve to seventeen, Newton was educated at The King's School, Grantham, which taught Latin and Greek and probably imparted a significant foundation of mathematics. He was removed from school and went back to his hometown in <time datetime="2019-08-04">October, 1659</time>. His mother attempted to make him a farmer which he detested. Henry Stokes, master of his school convinced Newton's mother to send him back to school. Motivated partly by a desire for revenge against a schoolyard bully, he became the top-ranked student, distinguishing himself maily by building sundials and models of windmills.
				</p>
				<p>
					In<time datetime="2019-08-04"> June 1661</time>, he was admitted to Trinity College, Cambridge, on the recommendation of his uncle Rev William Ayscough, who had studied there. He started as a subsizar - paying his way by performing valet duties - until he was awarded a scholarship in 1964, guareanteeing him four more years until he could attain his MA. He combined his college's teaching which was based on Aristotle with modern philosophers such as Descrates and astronomers such as Galileo and Thomas Street.
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1665, he discovered the generalised binomial theorem and  began to develop a mathematical theory that later became "Calculus". Soon after he obtained his BA degree in <time datetime="2019-08-04">August 1665</time>, the university temporarily closed. Although, he has been distinguished as a Cambridge student, Newton's private studies at his home over the subsequent two years saw  the development of his theories on calculus, optics, and the law of gravitation.
				</p>
				<p>
					In<time datetime="2019-08-04"> April 1667, he returned to Cambridge and in October was elected as a fellow of Trinity. His studies had impressed the Lucasian professor Isaac Barrow, who was the master of Trinity for two years. In 1669, Newton suceeded him, only one year after recieving his MA. He was elected as a Fellow of the Royal Society (FIRS) in 1672.

				<h5>Mathematics</h5>
				<p>
					Newton's work has been said "to distinctly advance every branch of mathematics then studied". His work on the subject usually referred to as fluxions or calculus, seen in a manuscript of October 1666, is now published among Newton's mathematical papers. His work extensively uses calculus in geometric forms basedon limiting values of the ratios of vanishingly small quantities: in the <i>Principia</i> itself. Because of this, the <i>Principa</i> has been called "a book dense with the theory and application of the infinitestimal calculus" in modern times and in newton's time "nearly all of  it is of this calculus".
				</p>
				<p>
					Newton is genrally credited with the generalised binomial theorem, valid for any exponent. He discovered Newton's identities, Newton's method, classified cubic plane curves (polynomials of degree three in two variables), made substantial contributions to the theory of finite differences, and was the first to use fractional indices and to employ coordinate geometry to derive solutions to Diophantine equations. He approximated partial sums of the harmonic series by logarithms and was the first to use power series with confidence and to revert power series. 
				</p>
				<p>
					Newton was appointed "Lucasian Professor of Mathematics" in 1669, on Baron's recommendation. 
				</p>
				<h5>Optics</h5>
				<p> 
					In 1666, Newton concluded that color is a property intrinsic to light - a point which has been debated in prior years. This was due to his observation of how prism refracts a spectrum of color by different angles in a light ray. From 1670 to 1672, Newton lectured on optics. In late 1668, he produced the first reflecting telescope which was about eight inches long and it gae a clearer and larger image. 
				</p>
				<p>
					In 1704, Newton published <i>Opticks</i> in which he expouded his corpuscular theory of light. He also constructed a primitive form of a frictional electrostatic generator, using a glass globe.
				</p>
				<h5>Mechanics and Gravitation</h5>
				<p>In 1679, Newton returned to his work on celestial mechanics by considering gravitation and its effect on the orbits of planets. In this work, Newton stated the three universal laws of motion, laying the foundation for classical mechanics.nHe used the Latin word <i>gravitas</i> (weight) for the effect that would becme known as gravity, and defined the "Law of Universal Gravitation".
				</p>
				<h5>Classification of cubics</h5>
				<p>
					Newton found 72 of the 78 "species" of cubic curves and categorised them into four types. In 1717, and probably with Newton's help, James Stirling proved that every cubic was one of these four types. Newton also claimed that the four types cold be obtained by plane projection form one of them, and this was proved in 1731, four years after his death.

				<p>
					In the 1690s, Newton wrote a number of religious tracts dealing with the literal and symbolic interpretation of the Bible. Newton was also a member of the Parliament of England for Cambridge University in 1689 and 1701.
				</p>
				<p>
					Newton moved to London to take up the post of warden of the Royal Mint in 1696, a position he had obtained through the patronage of Charles Montagu, 1st Earl of Halifax, then Chancellor of the Exchequer. Newton became perhaps the best-known Master of the Mint upon the death of Thomas Neale in 1699, a position Newton held for the last 30 years of his life. he  retired from his Cambridge duties in 1701. Newton was made Preseident of the Royal Society in 1703 and an associate of the French Academie des Sciences.
				</p>
				<p>
					In April 1705, Queen Anne knighted Newton during a royal visit to Trinity College, Cambridge.
				</p>
				<p>
					During the end of his life, Newton took up residence in Cranbury Park, near Winchester with his neice and her husband, until his death in 1727.

				<h4>Death</h4>
				<p>
					Newton died in his sleep in London on 20, March 1727. His body was buried in Westminster Abbey. A bachelor, he had divested much of his estate to relatives during his years, and died intestate. After his death, Newton's hair was examined and found to contain mercury, probably resulting from his alchemical pursuits. Mercury poisoning could explain Newton's eccentricity in late life.
